In order to answer right playing a live trivia game, I have started this project. Occasionally other people have collaborated on it. 

𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗮𝗺𝗲 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀:
There are 12 questions during which it's required to answer within 10 seconds choosing one between 3 given answers.

𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀:
It makes a screenshot from a mirrored smartphone, converts .png file into .txt file, according to the typology of the question the script searches on internet in different ways providing the estimated right answer.
The code, fully written in Python, is based on grammar rules, that's why it works only for the italian version of the game.

𝗟𝗶𝘀𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝘀𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝘁𝘆𝗽𝗲𝘀:
- standard and negative questions;
- questions in which two answers out of three could be right or wrong;
- historical comparison questions;
- geographical comparison questions;
